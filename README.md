## Collaboration & Ownership

This project was developed collaboratively with a teammate.

- The initial repository setup was done by a teammate.
- I forked the repository to independently develop and own the frontend.
- I was responsible for frontend architecture, drag-and-drop upload flows,
  file previews, reordering logic, UI components, and user experience decisions.
- I coordinated API contracts and integration with the backend.

This repository reflects my independent work and contributions on the frontend.





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
